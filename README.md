**CHALLENGE OVERVIEW

This project explores the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

**Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June Deliverable

**2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December Deliverable

Here are the takeaways between the two months-

-Minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and 56 degrees in December which shows the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 in June and 3.74 December we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

-Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees. Respectively, they show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two months.

-Maximum temperatures in June is 85 degresss and 83 in December which are similar.

**3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

The weather in June and  December are relativly  very similar, although December has a wider range of results.  With its high's being close to June's but, its low's well below June's

Additional queries that could help determin if ice cream and surfing all year is visable is Precipation. The difference between June and December to determine if one has more rainy weather. Also, veifiy at different stations as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
